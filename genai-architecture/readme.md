## Business Considerations

### Why GenAI? What Problems Does It Solve?
   - **Problem**: Traditional apps can be boring and one-size-fits-all.
   - **Solution**: GenAI makes learning adaptive and engaging.
   - **Result**: Happier users who stick around longer!

### How Complex Is This?
   - **Moving Parts**: Models, data, and servers work together behind the scenes.
   - **Maintenance**: Needs regular updates but isn’t “set and forget.”

### Costs at a Glance
   - **Servers**: Bigger models need beefier servers.
   - **Models**: Larger models cost more but perform better.
   - **People**: Skilled teams help manage and improve the system.

### Avoiding Vendor Lock-In
   - **Stay Flexible**: Use open-source tools so we’re not stuck with one provider.
   - **Plan Ahead**: Make sure our tech stack is easy to upgrade.
